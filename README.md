# SpaceJams
A web application that lets users listen to spotify playlists with other people! Users can join playlist rooms, listen to music, and chat with whoever else is listening with you.

## Getting Started
You can demo SpaceJams [here](https://petsmatch-frontend.herokuapp.com/). 

## Using SpaceJams

### 1) Logging in
If you aren't logged in, the welcome page for SpaceJams will prompt you to login with Spotify. SpaceJams uses your Spotify account to login, so if you have a Spotify account, there is no need to sign up!

### 2) Browse

On the browse screen you will find multiple rooms with Spotify playlists associated with them. For the sake of demoing, the app only uses public playlists created by Spotifty. You can see how many people are in each room at the bottom of each card. To enter a room just click the 'enter room' button on the playlist you want to listen to.

### 3) Room Features

Once inside a room, you can click on any track to start listening to them. On the right hand side is a live chatbox where you can talk to anyone else inside the room with you! Click the 'Users listening" button on the bottom right side to see who else is in he same room with you.
